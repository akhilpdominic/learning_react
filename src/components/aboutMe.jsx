                <p>Hi</p>
                I am a computer science student currently in my senior year. 
                My passion for computer science from a very young age led me to taking up
                Computer science as my field of study. Feel free to take a look at my side projects
                and if you have a suitable opening for me, please let me know ðŸ˜Š.
