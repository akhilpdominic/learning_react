# React repo

I have always heard about javascript being the best programming language in the world. So far, I have become quite comfortable with programming languages like python,C, dart etc. but never really found the motivation to learn javascript. But since I would be graduating in a few months, I feel its time to get started with js. I am doing a fcc course and along with that I am following youtube tutorials of reactjs. It has been going well so far, and i hope i would find the motivation to continue learning.

Here is the link to the youtube tutorial I am following : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU-drSVodBw
